			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> 
				I came from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I obtained my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2011 and December 2018, respectively. I also held a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Georgia Southern University in May 2014. My academic advisor is Prof. Yan Wang (Georgia Tech), and my postdoc mentor is Dr. Tim Wildey (SNL). 
			</p>

			<p>
				Upon graduation, I joined Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM in January 2019 as a postdoctoral appointee and became a LTE Senior Member of Technical Staff in Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification in September 2020.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm also a Dakota developer, mainly responsible for implementing efficient global optimization (EGO) extensions, e.g. different flavors of parallelizations.
			</p>

			<p>
				My research is somewhat centered around Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization, but recently I have been very attracted to machine learning and deep learning in general. I'm interested in nearly anything about applied mathematics, inverse problems, computational statistics, Bayesian statistics, computational materials science, computational fluid dynamics, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and of course, anything in between.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have a particular impression for people who dare to question orthodoxy and bring revolutionary questions to life, for what is lacking is not superficial design, but imagination greater than reality. I'm a regular coffee drinker, an amateur badminton and chess player.
			</p>
