			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I came from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I obtained my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2011 and December 2018, respectively. I also held a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Georgia Southern University in 2014. My academic advisor is Prof. Yan Wang (Georgia Tech), and my postdoc mentor is Dr. Tim Wildey (SNL). Upon graduation, I joined Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM in January 2019 as a postdoctoral appointee and became a LTE Senior Member of Technical Staff in Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification in September 2020.

			I'm also a Dakota developer, mainly responsible for implementing efficient global optimization (EGO) extensions, e.g. different flavors of parallelizations.

			My research is somewhat centered around Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization, but recently I have been very attracted to machine learning and deep learning in general. 

			You can reach me at either (anhtran [at] sandia [dot] gov) or (anh.vt2 [at] gmail [dot] com).
